# Project: Mom's Recipe Chest App

---

## What is the app idea?

The app, **Mom's Recipe Chest**, is a recipe management and ingredient inventory application designed to simplify meal planning, track ingredients on hand, and create shopping lists for missing items. It is ideal for busy moms and home cooks who want to organize recipes, manage pantry ingredients, and reduce food waste by knowing exactly what’s available before each cooking.

## Why is it something I want to develop?

As a busy mom of three, cooking time can be challenging, especially when I'm unsure of what to cook or what ingredients I have on hand. This project combines the functionalities of recipe organization and inventory tracking, addressing common frustrations in the kitchen—missing ingredients, recipe overload, and food waste.  As a developer, it’s a valuable project because it covers a wide range of front-end skills: dynamic UI updates and data management. By developing **Mom’s Recipe Chest**, I can create a practical tool for personal use while deepening my understanding of JavaScript, API integration, and UX design.
