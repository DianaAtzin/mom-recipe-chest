# Project: Mom's Recipe Chest App

---

## What is the app idea?

The app, **Mom's Recipe Chest**, is a recipe management and ingredient inventory application designed to simplify meal planning, track ingredients on hand, and create shopping lists for missing items. It is ideal for busy moms and home cooks who want to organize recipes, manage pantry ingredients, and reduce food waste by knowing exactly what’s available before each cooking.

## What will it do?

The app will allow users to:
- Search and filter a personal recipe collection.
- Track pantry inventory by adding ingredients with quantities and categories.
- Highlight recipes that can be made with available ingredients.
- Generate a shopping list based on missing ingredients for selected recipes.
- Adjust ingredient quantities based on serving size.
- Update ingredient inventory automatically when recipes are marked as “cooked.”
- Save favorite recipes for easy access.

## Why is it something I want to develop?

As a busy mom of three, cooking time can be challenging, especially when I'm unsure of what to cook or what ingredients I have on hand. This project combines the functionalities of recipe organization and inventory tracking, addressing common frustrations in the kitchen—missing ingredients, recipe overload, and food waste.  As a developer, it’s a valuable project because it covers a wide range of front-end skills: dynamic UI updates and data management. By developing **Mom’s Recipe Chest**, I can create a practical tool for personal use while deepening my understanding of JavaScript, API integration, and UX design.
